    <h1>Welcome to Lucas's Project 1 Website!</h1>
    <h2>To be honest, I didn't really know what to put on my home page, so bear with me.</h3>
  </header>
  <div>
    <p>Yes, you read that right. I have three pages including this one, and one of them is obviously my resume (as it was required), but, ironically, the one page I had no idea what to do with is this one, my <em>homepage</em>!<p>
    <p>In the end, I decided to just include something that might make everyone know me a bit better. But, as I'm not that much of a "fun facts!!!" guy, I thought it was better to list my interests somehow.</p>
    <p><strong>So, here's a few things I like, divided in categories!</strong></p>
  </div>
  <section>
    <h2>Lucas's Favorite Cuisines</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Japanese</li>
      <li>Thai</li>
      <li>Brazilian/Italian <em>(Tie)</em></li>
      <li>Chinese/Middle Eastern <em>(Tie)</em></li>
    </ol>
    <p>And we're starting off with something I love. Food! Honestly, this "ranking" is always subject to change, as I'm always trying new foods from the cuisines listed here as well as those from other countries/regions. One that probably isn't changing any time soon, though, is <strong>Japanese food</strong>. I like it so much that <em>one of my pages</em> is all about that!</p>
    <p>One cuisine that probably sticks out like a sore thumb here is Brazilian. Well, that's an easy one to answer: <em id="greentext">I'm Brazilian!</em> Of course my home food is gonna be great to me. If you're left wondering what Brazilian food is like, feel free to ask me!</p>
    <p>A final disclaimer: I love way more than just the cuisines I have listed here. If I had to include a few honorable mentions, they would probably be Mexican, Indian, and Korean. I just haven't tried enough foods from these to make a clear judgment.</p>

    <h2>Lucas's (Current) Favorite Music Genres</h2>
    <ul class="squarelist">
      <li>Drum and Bass</li>
      <li>Rock (and Metal)</li>
      <li>Electronic/EDM</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are in no particular order, because I usually don't like ranking my favorite things (I only do it for the above category, and a few other stuff). Anyway, these are the genres that I currently find myself listening to the most.</p>
    <p>Out of these, Drum and Bass is probably the one I listen to the most, which is why I put it first. It's not exactly the most popular genre, and it's definitely not for everyone. But, if you enjoy electronic music, or music that leans heavily on drums and rhythm, I'd say give it a chance!</p>

    <h2>(Some of) Lucas's Favorite Games</h2>
    <ul class="squarelist">
      <li><strong>GAME - GENRE, PLATFORM</strong></li>
      <li>Gran Turismo 4 - Racing, PlayStation 2</li>
      <li>Pok√©mon Black/White - RPG, Nintendo DS</li>
      <li>Battlefield 4 - Shooter, PC/Xbox/PlayStation</li>
      <li>RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 - Simulation, PC</li>
      <li>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive - Shooter, PC</li>
      <li>And many more...</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Again, no particular order.</em> Yeah, I love videogames. I'd say my taste in them is pretty varied, although there are some genres I won't touch with a ten-foot pole. The ones I have listed there are either big parts of my childhood, or ones I have more hours on than I'd like to admit.</p>
    <p>Aside from Counter-Strike, these are all games I can always go back to and be sure I'll have a good time. BTW, there's definitely a ton more games that could've made this short list, but I think that would make this list too bloated, and this page bigger than it already is.</p>

    <p>Congratulations! You reached the end of the page (hopefully without being bored to death). Thanks for taking a look at my crazy ramblings. As a reward, have a sunglasses emoji.</p>
