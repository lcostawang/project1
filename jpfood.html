    <h1>The page where I gush about Japanese food</h1>
  </header>
  <div>
    <p>I alluded to this on my homepage, but yes, one of my pages is ENTIRELY about Japanese food. That's how much I like it. I'm not joking.</p>
    <p>I don't even have a super specific, enlightening reason why I love it so much (heck, I'm not even Japanese!). I just grew up eating a lot of it and it eventually became my favorite cuisine by a long shot.</p>
    <p>Anyway, enough of my disclaimers, let's get to the topic! I'm separating this in four categories, which is how I usually divide Japanese food in my head:</p>
    <ol id="numerals">
      <li>Rice dishes</li>
      <li>Noodle/soup dishes</li>
      <li>Other hot dishes</li>
      <li>Cold dishes (usually sushi/sashimi)</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Rice Dishes</h2>
    <img id="gyudon" src="media/gyudon.JPG" alt="Picture of a Gyudon (beef rice) bowl">
    <p>It's no secret that rice is a staple of Japanese cuisine. This means that one of the most common types of dish in Japan (and many other places) is the good ol' "rice with stuff". Lucky for me, because Japanese sushi-style rice is my favorite type of rice, so much so that I can eat it by itself and still enjoy it! So, let's explore some of the great rice dishes that the Japanese cuisine has to offer.</p>
    <p>Firstly, let's talk about rice bowls. I believe the general term for those in Japanese is <em>donburi</em>. You can spot these bowl dishes by their name, more specifically by their suffix "-don". Pretty simple concept: fill a bowl with rice, then top it with meat, vegetables, or whatever you want! Some of my favorites include gyudon (beef rice bowl), katsudon (fried pork cutlet rice bowl), oyakodon (chicken and egg rice bowl), and ebi tendon (shrimp tempura rice bowl).</p>
    <p>Next, we have a possibly controversial one: Japanese curry rice! Why did I say controversial? Well, usually when someone hears the word curry, the first thing that comes to their mind is Indian curry, and rightfully so. However, I personally think Japanese curry rice might be even better than its Indian counterpart! That's not to say Indian (or other types of) curry is bad (on the contrary, I love curry of all kinds!), but for some reason, I just like the Japanese version more. If you've never tried it, I urge you to.</p>
    <p>Finally, fried rice! Okay, I might be cheating with this one. "Dude, pretty much every country in Asia has its own version of fried rice, it's not a Japanese dish." I hear you, but I think it'd be a mistake to ignore this staple comfort food. After all, it's such a common dish in Asia for a reason. Again, simple concept. Get some leftover rice and some eggs/meat/vegetables/whatever you have lying in your fridge, then fry it all together, optionally with some extra seasoning or sauce. You'd be surprised at how it tastes like way more than just the sum of its parts.</p>
    <p>Before we move on, I wanna mention that I probably haven't even scratched the surface of the types of rice dishes in Japan, and a very common way to eat rice there is simply as a side dish (which I usually do). So, if you wanna explore new Japanese foods, I say rice is a very good way to start!</p>

    <h2>Noodle/Soup Dishes</h2>
    <img id="ramen" src="media/ramen.jpg" alt="Picture of a Shio Ramen bowl">
    <p>Just because rice is the staple grain of Japan, it doesn't mean that noodles are less important or delicious there. Many of the great classic Japanese dishes are some kind of noodle or soup dish, as I hope to demonstrate here.</p>
    <p>First, I wanna talk about ramen (Not the instant kind!!! I mean like the picture above). If you've ever wanted a dish that bridges the gap between comforting instant noodles and a "gourmet" noodle dish, traditional Japanese ramen has your back. Noodles, a soup base, an aroma/seasoning oil, and a variety of toppings. Mix and match these components and you get many (equally delicious) kinds of ramen! Shio ramen, shoyu ramen, miso ramen, tonkotsu ramen, you get the idea. Honestly, few things in life compare to the experience that is eating a nice bowl of ramen.</p>
    <p>Now, the thing about ramen is that it's so good and popular around the world, it ends up overshadowing pretty much every other Japanese noodle dish. So, I want to highlight a few other favorites of mine in this category. Udon are thick, chewy noodles, usually in soup, and are amazing especially in colder days. Soba, meanwhile, is all about the raw ingredients and the texture. These are buckwheat noodles, and one of the common ways to eat soba is to have it cold with a special dipping sauce. Both of these are awesome noodle types, so please give them a try if you've never done so!</p>
    <p>The last thing I wanna highlight here is the (sometimes) unsung hero of Japanese set meals: miso soup! If you've ever had that little bowl of soup with tofu, scallions and seaweed as a side dish in a Japanese restaurant, this is it. A staple side dish that makes any set meal feel complete.</p>

    <h2>Other Hot Dishes</h2>
    <img id="katsu" src="media/katsu.JPG" alt="Picture of Tonkatsu (fried pork cutlet)">
    <p>Of course, not everything in Japan is cooked in conjunction with rice or noodles. Here, I'm gonna show you some of my favorite "standalone" dishes (that, of course, are all great with rice as a side dish :P).</p>
    <p>Firstly, fried foods! I personally love fried foods in general, and I think Japan gets them super right. There's the aforementioned tonkatsu (fried pork cutlet), which is pretty popular outside Japan. Of course, you can give other meats the "katsu" treatment, like chicken and beef. Moving on, we have karaage (Japanese fried chicken), which, even though it is overshadowed by its more popular cousin, Korean fried chicken, still packs a punch (and is personally my favorite between the two). Finally, we have tempura, which moreso refers to a way of breading and frying virtually anything, with amazing results!</p>
    <p>We move from fried to grilled now, with two personal favorites of mine. Teppanyaki refers to food grilled on a flat iron surface. I can't tell why, but teppanyaki dishes have a specific grilled flavor that I can never get enough of. Next, there's yakiniku (literally "grilled meat"), which is the Japanese counterpart to the very popular Korean BBQ, and dare I say the better version!</p>
    <p>I don't know where else to put this, but I also want to praise the multitude of "fusion" dishes that other countries do to adapt Japanese food to their tastes. Some of these transformations are genuinely awesome!</p>

    <h2>The part where I talk about Sushi</h2>
    <p>Okay, time to address the elephant in the room. When most people think about Japanese food, their mind usually goes to sushi, rolls made of rice and (usually) raw fish or vegetables. So why is this section in last?</p>
    <p>Well, I have to come clean with you: although I enjoy sushi and sashimi (just raw fish), I simply don't like these as much as the other categories discussed above. To me, part of the pleasure of eating is having <em>hot</em> food, and sushi/sashimi just doesn't offer that. (Sidenote: I'm also not the biggest fan of salad for the same reason)</p>
    <p>Yes, sometimes I do crave some sushi, but I can genuinely tell you that if sushi and sashimi weren't part of Japanese cuisine, its #1 spot on my world cuisines ranking wouldn't really change at all. It's just not why I enjoy Japanese food so much. Although, I can say I definitely respect sushi masters, the way they prepare sushi will always look awesome to me!</p>
